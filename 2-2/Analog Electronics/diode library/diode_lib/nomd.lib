*
* The model library included with the production version of PSpice A/D
* includes over 14,000 analog devices, and over 1,800 digital devices.
*
*
* It takes time for PSpice to scan a library file.  To speed this up, PSpice
* creates an index file, called <filename>.IND. The index file is re-created
* whenever PSpice senses that the library file has changed.
